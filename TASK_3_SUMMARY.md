# Task 3 Implementation Summary

## Task: Create gRPC service definitions and protobuf files

### Completed Sub-tasks:

#### ✅ Define protobuf messages for all service interfaces
- Created comprehensive `.proto` files for all services:
  - `common.proto` - Common message types (DialogRef, Timestamp, ServiceStatus)
  - `loader.proto` - Service lifecycle management and dialog coordination
  - `logger.proto` - Centralized logging service
  - `kwd.proto` - Wake word detection service
  - `stt.proto` - Speech-to-text service
  - `llm.proto` - Large language model service
  - `tts.proto` - Text-to-speech service

#### ✅ Generate Python gRPC stubs from protobuf definitions
- Generated Python stubs using `grpc_tools.protoc`
- Fixed import issues to use relative imports
- Created automated generation script at `scripts/generate_protos.py`
- Added Makefile targets for easy regeneration

#### ✅ Implement base service class with health check integration
- Enhanced existing `BaseService` class in `services/base.py`
- Integrated gRPC Health Checking Protocol (requirement 6.6)
- Added `HealthServicer` implementation
- Included service lifecycle management with health monitoring

#### ✅ Create service registration and discovery utilities
- Implemented comprehensive `ServiceRegistry` class
- Added `ServiceDiscovery` with startup/shutdown ordering
- Created `ServiceClient` for gRPC channel management
- Defined service types and default ports (requirement 8.4)
- Added health monitoring and service dependency validation

### Requirements Addressed:

**Requirement 6.6**: ✅ "WHEN health checks are performed THEN each service SHALL respond via gRPC Health Checking Protocol"
- All services inherit from `BaseService` which includes gRPC Health Checking Protocol
- `HealthServicer` implements the standard `grpc.health.v1.Health` service
- Services automatically register health status and respond to health checks

**Requirement 8.4**: ✅ "WHEN configuration includes service ports THEN services SHALL bind to specified gRPC ports (5001-5006)"
- Service registry defines default ports for all services (5001-5006)
- Services bind to configured ports through the base service class
- Port configuration is validated and managed through the registry

### Files Created/Modified:

**New Protobuf Files:**
- `services/proto/common.proto`
- `services/proto/loader.proto`
- `services/proto/logger.proto`
- `services/proto/kwd.proto`
- `services/proto/stt.proto`
- `services/proto/llm.proto`
- `services/proto/tts.proto`

**Generated Stub Files:**
- All corresponding `*_pb2.py` and `*_pb2_grpc.py` files
- Fixed imports for proper module resolution

**New Implementation Files:**
- `services/registry.py` - Service registration and discovery
- `services/proto/__init__.py` - Enhanced with convenient imports
- `scripts/generate_protos.py` - Automated protobuf generation
- `Makefile` - Build automation

**Test Files:**
- `tests/test_proto.py` - Protobuf message and stub tests
- `tests/test_registry.py` - Service registry and discovery tests

### Test Results:
- All 54 tests passing
- Comprehensive coverage of protobuf serialization
- Service registry functionality validated
- gRPC stub imports working correctly

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Complete gRPC Service Definitions**: All services have well-defined protobuf interfaces
2. **Health Check Integration**: Standard gRPC health checking for all services
3. **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration with startup ordering
4. **Port Management**: Default port assignments with conflict detection
5. **Channel Management**: Automatic gRPC channel creation and cleanup
6. **Import Convenience**: Easy-to-use imports for all protobuf types
7. **Build Automation**: Scripts and Makefile for easy development workflow

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the gRPC-based service architecture required by the AI Voice Assistant system.
